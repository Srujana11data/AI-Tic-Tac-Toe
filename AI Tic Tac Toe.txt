Step 1: Representing the Tic-Tac-Toe Board

We'll represent the Tic-Tac-Toe board as a 3x3 grid. We can use a list of lists for this purpose, where each cell can be 'X', 'O', or empty (' ').
board = [[' ', ' ', ' '],
         [' ', ' ', ' '],
         [' ', ' ', ' ']]

Step 2: Defining the Game State

We need a function to check the current state of the game. We'll check for win conditions (a player has won), a draw, or the game still being in progress.

def check_game_state(board):
    # Check rows, columns, and diagonals for a win
    # ...

    # Check for a draw
    if ' ' not in [cell for row in board for cell in row]:
        return 'Draw'

    # The game is still in progress
    return 'InProgress'

Step 3: MiniMax Algorithm with Alpha-Beta Pruning

Implement the MiniMax algorithm to make the AI's decisions. This algorithm explores the game tree and chooses the best move for the AI player while considering the opponent's optimal moves.

def minimax(board, depth, maximizing_player, alpha, beta):
    game_state = check_game_state(board)

    if game_state != 'InProgress':
        # Return a score based on the game outcome
        if game_state == 'X wins':
            return 1
        elif game_state == 'O wins':
            return -1
        else:
            return 0

    if maximizing_player:
        max_eval = -float('inf')
        for row in range(3):
            for col in range(3):
                if board[row][col] == ' ':
                    board[row][col] = 'X'
                    eval = minimax(board, depth + 1, False, alpha, beta)
                    board[row][col] = ' '
                    max_eval = max(max_eval, eval)
                    alpha = max(alpha, eval)
                    if beta <= alpha:
                        break
        return max_eval
    else:
        min_eval = float('inf')
        for row in range(3):
            for col in range(3):
                if board[row][col] == ' ':
                    board[row][col] = 'O'
                    eval = minimax(board, depth + 1, True, alpha, beta)
                    board[row][col] = ' '
                    min_eval = min(min_eval, eval)
                    beta = min(beta, eval)
                    if beta <= alpha:
                        break
        return min_eval


Step 4: Making the AI's Move

Using the MiniMax algorithm, we can make the AI player's move. It will analyze the game tree and select the move that maximizes its chances of winning.

def ai_move(board):
    best_move = None
    best_eval = -float('inf')
    alpha = -float('inf')
    beta = float('inf')

    for row in range(3):
        for col in range(3):
            if board[row][col] == ' ':
                board[row][col] = 'X'
                eval = minimax(board, 0, False, alpha, beta)
                board[row][col] = ' '

                if eval > best_eval:
                    best_eval = eval
                    best_move = (row, col)

    row, col = best_move
    board[row][col] = 'X'

Step 5: Human Player's Move

Allow the human player to make their move and update the game board accordingly.

def human_move(board):
    while True:
        try:
            row = int(input("Enter the row (0, 1, 2): "))
            col = int(input("Enter the column (0, 1, 2): "))

            if board[row][col] == ' ':
                board[row][col] = 'O'
                break
            else:
                print("Invalid move. Try again.")
        except (ValueError, IndexError):
            print("Invalid input. Try again.")

Step 6: Main Game Loop

Create a loop that alternates between the human player's and AI player's moves until the game is over.

while True:
    # Human player's move
    human_move(board)
    print_board(board)
    if check_game_state(board) != 'InProgress':
        break

    # AI player's move
    ai_move(board)
    print_board(board)
    if check_game_state(board) != 'InProgress':
        break

Step 7: Game Outcome

After the game loop exits, you can determine and display the game outcome based on the return value of check_game_state(board).

This is a simplified example of building a Tic-Tac-Toe AI using the MiniMax algorithm with Alpha-Beta Pruning. You can further refine and expand this code, adding features like user interfaces and more robust AI strategies. The key takeaway is to understand the core algorithmic concepts behind MiniMax and Alpha-Beta Pruning, which are fundamental to many game-playing AI applications.
